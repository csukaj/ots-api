# OTS Procedures

## Development
You will need static type checker like "pyright". (You can download it for vscode.)
The files are formatted by "Black" with "--line-length 110".

For tests you will need the "mock" library.
For types you will need the "typing" library. 
These can be installed by pip.

For remote debugging see your IDE's needs.
